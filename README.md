# Optimization---Gradient-Descent-and-Newton-s-Method

This exercise was an course assignment in the course Mobile Robotics at Northeastern University. 

I have implemented Gradient Descent and Newton's method on the function f(x,y) = x^2 - x*y + k*y^2
where k determines the contours of the function, a higher k resulting in flatter contours in one direction. 

In this code, I have explored and studied the effects of contours on the effectiveness of gradient descent algorithm to find a minima and compared it with that of Newton method's 
performance.
